## British Airways Data Science Job Simulation â€“ March 2025
Project Overview
This project is part of the British Airways Data Science Virtual Job Simulation on Forage. The objective is to understand customer behavior by leveraging data science techniques to analyze customer reviews and build a predictive model for booking behavior.

# Problem Statement
Customers today have access to a wealth of information, which influences their travel decisions. British Airways needs data-driven insights to understand what influences customers to book flights or holidays. The goal of this project is:

Analyze customer review data to uncover insights about customer satisfaction.
Build a predictive model to determine the likelihood of a customer booking a flight based on available data.

# Key Tasks & Approach

1. Sentiment Analysis on British Airways Reviews
Scraped customer review data from Skytrax to analyze customer sentiment.
Used NLP techniques to process text data and extract key themes from feedback.
Generated visualizations to highlight key pain points and satisfaction drivers.

2. Predictive Modeling for Customer Bookings
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared customer booking data for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Extracted key features like trip type, purchase lead time, and preferences.
Model Selection: Used Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a customer would book a flight.
Evaluation: Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Key Findings & Insights

Customer sentiment analysis revealed that 46%-negative reviews, 51%-positive reviews and 3%-neutral reviews.
The predictive model achieved an accuracy of 90%, indicating strong predictive power.
The most important factors influencing bookings were purchase lead time, trip type, and extra baggage preference.

# Technologies & Tools Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
NLP: NLTK, TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
GitHub & Forage (for project documentation and simulation completion)
